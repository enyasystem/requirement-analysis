# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction
This repository is created to demonstrate the concept of *Requirement Analysis* in software development. 

Requirement Analysis is the process of understanding, documenting, and managing the needs and expectations of users and stakeholders for a software system. It forms the foundation for designing, building, and validating software that meets real-world objectives.

The goal of this project is to explore the different stages, techniques, and best practices used in requirement analysis as part of the software development life cycle (SDLC).
