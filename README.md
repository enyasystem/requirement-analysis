# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction
This repository is created to demonstrate the concept of *Requirement Analysis* in software development. 

Requirement Analysis is the process of understanding, documenting, and managing the needs and expectations of users and stakeholders for a software system. It forms the foundation for designing, building, and validating software that meets real-world objectives.

The goal of this project is to explore the different stages, techniques, and best practices used in requirement analysis as part of the software development life cycle (SDLC).

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis plays a vital role in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) because it sets the foundation for successful project delivery. Here are some key reasons why it is important:

1. **Clarity and Understanding**
   - It ensures that developers, designers, and stakeholders share a clear understanding of what the system should do.  
   - This reduces confusion and prevents costly misunderstandings later in the project.

2. **Better Project Planning**
   - With well-defined requirements, project managers can create accurate timelines, allocate resources effectively, and estimate costs with confidence.  
   - This leads to smoother execution and fewer unexpected issues during development.

3. **Minimizes Rework and Costs**
   - Identifying requirements early helps detect potential issues before coding begins.  
   - Fixing problems during the requirement phase is far cheaper than fixing them after deployment.

4. **Improves Quality**
   - Clear and complete requirements ensure the final product meets user expectations, resulting in higher satisfaction and better performance.

5. **Supports Validation and Testing**
   - Testers rely on well-documented requirements to design test cases and verify that the software meets all specified needs.
